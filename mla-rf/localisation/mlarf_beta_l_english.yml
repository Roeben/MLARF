 beta.2.d:0 "A large explosion over the skies of Kashgar shocks the scientific communities of the world today. The event in question is thought to be a large meteor explosion similar to the infamous Tunguska Event.\n\n It is clear that the situation is still highly unstable and contact with any authorities in the province remain unreliable and intermittant.\n\n Humanitarian aid is being prepared, but the relative isolation of the area suggests help may not come any time soon."
 beta.2.a:0 "We pray for their safety."
